# Spirograph Art Generator

## Repository
https://github.com/abrivera96/spirograph-art/tree/main

## Description
A program that generates Spirograph Art. You will be allowed to customize the shape, color, and size. Not feeling creative?
No Worries! It will randomize one for you!



## Features
- Generates Spirographs. 
  This program will create digital art in the form of spirograph shapes. 
- Customization in color, size, & shape. 
  Additionally, it will allow the user to input preferred color, shape, and size.
- Randomization.
  Lastly, there will be an option that allows the user to bypass cutomization 
  and randomize an output.

  ## Challenges
  - Randomizing multiple shapes at a time without the program crashing.
  - I want there to be an animated aspect to this, but will have to research more before I commit to the idea. 

  ## Outcomes
  Ideal Outcome:
  - Ideally, I would like for this program to have an animated aspect to it where the spirograph(s) spin to 
    visually represent spinning flowers.

  Minimal Viable Outcome:
  - At the very least, I want the program to have the ability to customize and randomize a piece of spirographic art.

  Milestones:
  - Week 1
    1. I want to start with a code that can make multiple shapes simultaneously. 
    2. Work on user inputs for user customization. 
  - Week 2
    1. Continue to work on customization. 
    2. Impliment randomization and set parameters for a general design to follow. 
  - Week 3 (Final)
    1. Attempt an animated feature.
