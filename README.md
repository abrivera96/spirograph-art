## Description
For this project, I wanted to lean more into the artistic side of coding and create something that generates art. I had the idea of creating simple patterns 
with user input to allow customization and a save feature should the user want to use their art for other purposes. To take it a step further, I wanted to
add an option to randomize the settings so that way there was a more dynamic use case for it.
